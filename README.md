A. You have been tasked with designing a database schema to track student enrollment in courses at a university. Each course has a unique ID, name and description. Each student has a unique ID, a name, an email address, and a graduation year. A student can be enrolled in multiple courses, and a course can have multiple students enrolled. Each enrollment should also track the enrollment date.

Design a SQL schema for this problem, including the necessary tables, columns, and relationships.

Constraints:

- Use PostgreSQL syntax to solve this problem.

C. We'd like you to implement a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm for a tree using traversal methods (preorder, postorder, and inorder) in TypeScript. Additionally, we'd like you to implement the factory design pattern to allow the user to choose which traversal method to use.


Traversal orders are as follows:
- Pre-order: parent → left child → right child

- Post-order: left child → right child → parent

- In-order: left child → parent → right child


Example:


treeNode = {

  1: [2, 3],

  2: [4, 5],

  3: [],

  4: [],

  5: [6, 7],

  6: [],

  7: [8],

  8: []

}


Pre-order Ouput: [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3]

Post-order Ouput: [4, 6, 8, 7, 5, 2, 3, 1]

In-order Output: [4, 2, 6, 5, 8, 7, 1, 3]

Constraints:

- Solve the problem using TypeScript but i using JavaScript Solve the problem. Sorry!

- Do not use any libraries to solve the problem.

- Create test cases for each of the three traversal orders.
